> GM: can I just say, I hate 

>     that = this

>     or

>     self = this

> GM: don't anyone do that

> GM: the pattern is fine, but at least give it a meaningful name

> JA: hmmm.....i'll bite, devil's advocate

> GM: "that" is incredibly unhelpful

> JA: why not folow an established convention?

> JA: when javascript programmers see variable name "that", they immediately know what's happening

> TS: anyone who has worked in JS for more than 10 seconds does :)

> GM: @TS -  right, they know that its passed in from a higher scope. BUT in order to know what the actual object is they have to scan the whole file

> SP: yeah. it can get frustrating

> GM: It really takes like 2 seconds to just think of an appropriate name for hte variable

> GM: I usually prefix with an _ just so that it sticks out a bit visually: _userModel, _slideViewer, _dialogWidget

> GM: its not perfect but its a heck of a lot better than "that"

> JA: i suppose if you named it the same as your object or function, it might be fine

> GM: my point though is - that variables, functions, everything should almost always be named after what they do/represent, not how they're implemented. So when you've got "that" in two different files that have nothing to do 
with > each other, we're obviously breaking that guideline. The argument that it's a well known pattern is fine, except that there's really no reason not to give it an even MORE descriptive name

> GM: so I guess my real point is name things properly, it will be better for everyone always and "that", "self" are just not great names
