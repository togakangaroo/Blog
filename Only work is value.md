A friend recently emailed me outraged. An idea she had pitched during a hackathon a year ago just launched as an app created by someone else in the local community, they had copied it right down to the name!

So first of all, let me make clear that I do not believe anyone - much less the creator of the app - was at fault. I truly believe that the idea either came to him directly or filtered through enough "what ifs" that he can claim it as his own. Nor do I believe that the name came from her directly. I have a good idea how it came to be and suffice to say it was filtered through a broken telephone of hackathon nights, no sleep, and the general fact that many people in the local developer community spend many hours together.

I don't want to talk about this controversy as I do not believe there is anything to controverse about. Instead I want to talk about the concept of *claiming* an idea.

This very thought made me react inappropriately upon seeing some comments on Facebook about the whole affair and post a minor diatribe which has since been removed. It wasn't constructive and I'm sure made my friend feel even worse. I'm sorry.

I want to explain - in more civilized terms - why the concept throws me apparently for a rage-filled loop. I would say that I've been a developer capable of creating applications in some form since
