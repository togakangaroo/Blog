Other than *"Meh - you can just store that in a file"* I don't often have stuff to say about databases. That's why it's somewhat
surprising that I keep getting invited back to talk at Sql Saturday Baton Rouge.

At the 2013 one I gave a talk on how to get started with and use Knockout.Js.

My slides are an impress.js website with built in examples. Super-fun.

And until I decide to take it down [the site is also online here.](http://togakangaroo.bitbucket.org/)
